    A render() function can also be a fine place to put simple calculations that need to happen right before a component renders. Here’s an example of some calculations inside of a render function:

class Random extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // First, some logic that must happen
    // before rendering:
    const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
    // Next, a return statement
    // using that logic:
    return <h1>The number is {n}!</h1>;
  }
}
Watch out for this common mistake:

class Random extends React.Component {
  // This should be in the render function:
  const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);

  render() {
    return <h1>The number is {n}!</h1>;
  }
};
In the above example, the line with the const n declaration will cause a syntax error, as is it should not be part of the class declaration itself, but should occur in a method like render().
