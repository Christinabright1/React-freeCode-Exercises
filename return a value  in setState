setState() is just a function you call. You doesn't change anything about javascript.
A framework like React can't change the rules of the language.
- update the state: this is why you use setState
- return a value: this is why you use "return"

  generateTarget = () => {
    const target = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9);
    this.setState({ target });
    return target;
  };
  generateComputerValue = () => {
    const computer = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
    this.setState({
      computer
    });
    return computer;
  };
