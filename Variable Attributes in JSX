When writing JSX, it’s common to use variables to set attributes.

Here’s an example of how that might work:

// Use a variable to set the `height` and `width` attributes:

const sideLength = "200px";

const panda = (
  <img 
    src="images/panda.jpg" 
    alt="panda" 
    height={sideLength} 
    width={sideLength} />
);
